I was only able to determine certain edge cases, such as when the sequence is simply too short to contain the string, and when the sequence/string itself is null. However, I wasn't able to figure out a non compare every value solution to the problem- and with chromosome 22 - it would take such a long time and never entirely complete. Most of this time was just spent ideating, but i wasn't able to surpass the char by char comparision issue. (length of sequence x length of str time complexity) |

Since this is  the case, the only way to reduce time complexity is not have the entire sequence length be iterated over-- which I have yet to figure out how to do. I spent much of this time discussing with classmates what potential solutions could be. |
| 10/15 | 11:20 - 11:50 am |                                       Continued to talk with my classmates regarding solutions to the comparision issue. One idea we had was assigning a numerical value to the entirety of the str as a whole, and then comparing that number with each segment of the sequence could work. However, the time complexity of calculating a unique number likley will take so long that the whole purpose of the algorithm goes down the drain. We also thought of creating some sort of prefix table where initial segments of the str would be tracked meaning that you don't have to go fully back when reaching a mistake, however, again, I think this will still lead to the same amount of comparisions because at the end of the day you are comparing prefixes not strings. So... after this session i have reached back where I started. |
| 10/16 |   3:50-4:15 pm   | I decided to simply start coding the long solution (literally compare everything) and implemented a simple for loop solution comparing str length segments of seq with str. However, when looking up methods to compare segments of a large string with a seperate string I found the compare region section-- which I am not sure has a faster runtime (i dont think it does) and is likley just a fancy way of writing .equals without having to substring, so I still need to work further to figure out an efficient way to implement the solution. However, I do now have a functioning solution (albeit with an almost 3 second runtime) so I have something to work off of. I am now just going to add some comments and the update my worklog and submit this initial version, while I continue to brainstorm a more efficient solution.  |
